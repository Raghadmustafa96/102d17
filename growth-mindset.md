# Growth Mindset

A **growth mindset** believes that one’s fundamental abilities can be developed through perseverance and effort; 
intelligence and talent are simply good starting points. 
A growth mindset is synonymous with a love of learning.

By contrast, in a fixed mindset, intelligence and talent are seen as fixed traits, suggesting that
success comes from these inherent qualities alone, without the need for further development or effort.


## I’ve learned to to keep myself in a growth mindset to ask myself some questions:

### What was the best part of the day?
What went wrong, and how can I make sure it doesn’t happen again?
These questions help me focus on all aspects of my day, the good and the bad, and they help me internalize strategies for creating more good days going forward.

### Which aspects of my work am I most proud of?
What can I do to improve the aspects I’m less proud of?
That’s the dark side of growth, I guess…
