**Computer is changing the world, it's on desktop, home any where, and most of us use this technology daily.**

## How computer works?
Computer science explored how to design a thinking machine,
They realized that it had to perform 4 different task:
* take input
* storage information
* process information
* output the results

The earlier computer made by wood and materials but by 20th start using electrical components.
They have slow and large, it takes more time to do basic math problems. 

Computer start as basic calculations. 

Input : stuff that the world does on that you do that makes computer do stuff

Storage :  the information stored in memory it manipulate using an algorithm and then send it information again to be stored in memory. 

Output : computer display can show text, photos 

Computer works on one and zero 
The signal could either be on or off 

With one wire can represent yes or no, true or false, one or zero 
This called a bit the smallest piece of information on computer can store

With this bit we can represent more complex information. 

Binary no of system we have only 2 digit 0, 1 

Decimal no system, we have ten digits 0_9

Computer have basic circuit 
Add, or, nand, xor,
