# JavaScript 

Web developers usually talk about three languages that are used to create web pages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

JavaScript is written in plain text, just like HTML and CSS, so you do not need any new tools to write a script. 

A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one. Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement. Statements should end with a semicolon. 


JAVASCRIPT IS CASE SENSITIVE JavaScript is case sensitive so hourNow means something different to HourNow or HOURNOW. 

You should write comments to explain what your code does. They help make your code easier to read and understand. This can help you and others who read your code. 

`/*   */`

A script will have to temporarily store the bits of information it needs to do its job. It can store this data in variables. 

DATA TYPES JavaScript distinguishes between numbers, strings, and true or false values known as Booleans.
