## Comparison and logical operators: 

You can evaluate a situation by comparing one value in the script to what you expect it might be. The result will be a Boolean: true or false.


* IS EQUAL TO 
`==`
This operator compares two values (numbers, strings, ar Booleans) to see if they are the same.


* IS NOT EQUAL 
`! =`
This operator compares two values (numbers. strings, or Booleans) to see if they are not the same.


* STRICT EQUAL TO 
`===`

This operator compares two values to check that bath the data type and value are the same.

* STRICT NOT EQUAL TO This operator.  
`! ==`
compares two values to check that both the data type and value are not the same. 

and also have `>, <, >=, <=`


## LOOPS
Loops check a condition. If it returns true, a code block will run. Then the condition will be checked again and if it still returns true, the code block will run again. It repeats until the condition returns false. There are three common types of loops:  

1. FOR  
If you need to run code a specific number of times, use a for loop. (It is the most common loop.) In a for loop, the condition is usually a counter which is used to tell how many times the loop should run.

1. WHILE 
f you do not know how many times the code should run, you can use a while loop. Here the condition can be something other than a counter, and the code will continue to loop for as long as the condition is true.

1. DO WHILE 
The do...while loop is very similar to the while loop, but has one key difference: it will always run the statements inside the curly braces at least once, even if the condition evaluates to false.
