My name is **Raghad Mustafa** , I am 24 years old, I studied computer engineering at Yarmouk University.
after graduated I worked for 9 months as software automation engineer, as automation tester.
but I want really to change my career and be a good full stack programmer, 
So I quit my job and decided to join **ASAC LTUC** family, to be a good software engineer.

Very happy to be joining you, and so glad to be a part of this journey.
