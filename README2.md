HTML, is markup language not (programming language ) when you written in certain way it can figure how to display this code in the browser. 
HTML Uses a tag, indicate and tells browser how to display content and which content mean,  and it have 
Open tag and closing tag. 

### How to build web pages? 
* In the first, we should think to idea of this page, content, why using these webpage, who people visit my page 

* The second thing, should go to the  wireframes that is a sketch clarifying how my page look like,or  create the layout for webpage. 
The basic structure of HTML are the head,  main and footer 

When we start writing the HTML pages it start with 
<! DOCTYPE html >
all of the code should be between open <html>  and </html> ,  the two main tags are the head and the body on HTML. 

#### HTML have the two type of List :
* Ordered list that have a tag 
  `<ol>  </ol>` 
* un ordered list that have a tag 
`<ul> </ul>`

When we want to create links on HTML we use Anchor tag 
<a> </a>the text between this tag it appear on web pages. 

When we add additional information we should use the attribute it tell more information about tag has name =value it add inside open tag 

**ID** is a unique value 

**Class**: we can give it for multiple tag that in the same class

**Image tag** in HTML its appear like this
`<img src=" "  alt=" " >`
 It's without Clos tag, because image do not have content. 

Alternative text for image, describe if the image not available or 
browser can't open the image for any reason 

**Section tag** is include all the tag which have the same topices.
